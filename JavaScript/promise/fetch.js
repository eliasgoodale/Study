/*
		For this example, we will be using the fetch API. Fetch provides a generic definition of Request and Response objects. The fetch() method intakes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch, and returns a Promise that resolves to a Response
		to that request. You may also pass in an init options object as the second argument. Once the Response object is retrieved there are 
		many methods available to define what the body content is and how it will be handled
